# ToolBox - Image Enhancement Toolkit

**ToolBox** is a powerful collection of image enhancement tools that offer a variety of functionalities aimed at improving the quality and features of images. The toolkit leverages Pythonâ€™s rich ecosystem of libraries to provide users with a comprehensive suite of tools for tasks such as image resizing, filtering, enhancement, and even more advanced features like face detection.

This project is built using key Python libraries like **Tkinter**, **OpenCV**, and **Pillow**, allowing for both GUI-based interactions and efficient image processing.

## Key Features:

- **Image Enhancement**: Improve brightness, contrast, and sharpness of images.
- **Filtering**: Apply different filters to enhance or transform images.
- **Face Detection**: Automatically detect and highlight faces in an image using OpenCV.
- **Resize and Crop**: Allow users to resize and crop images with ease.
- **User-friendly GUI**: The interface is designed using Tkinter, providing an intuitive way to interact with the toolkit without the need for programming knowledge.

## Technologies Used:

- **Python**: The main programming language used for the toolkit, chosen for its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries.

- **Tkinter**: A standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Tkinter is used to provide a user-friendly front-end for the toolkit, allowing users to perform image manipulation tasks with ease and interactively.

- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for image processing tasks, OpenCV is used extensively in the project for applying various image enhancements, filters, and for the face detection feature.

- **Pillow**: A fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), Pillow is used for basic image operations like opening, editing, and saving images.

- **NumPy**: Often used in conjunction with OpenCV, NumPy is employed for efficient matrix operations, especially when handling image transformations and modifications.

## How It Works:

The project presents a simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) where users can load images, apply different enhancements, and save the results. Behind the scenes, the toolkit utilizes **OpenCV** for advanced image processing and computer vision tasks (such as face detection), while **Pillow** and **Tkinter** work together for basic manipulations and GUI elements.

The combination of these tools ensures that the toolkit is both easy to use and capable of handling more complex image processing tasks.
